				Here is Amare, one of my favorite Pizza restaurants.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
		It can be found near the the southern part of Tagytay near Twin Lakes.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		I find their food to be exquisite, specifically their Neapolitan Pizzas and their meatballs.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
		I highly recommend you to go try their food if you ever go to Tagaytay.

		Here is the Twin Lakes Vineyard Residences, a resort I visited in April 2023 as my birthday vacation.
		<br>
		<br>
				<br>
		The view here is magnificent. You can see a vast array of green when you look out of your room.
		<br>
		<br>
				<br>
		The rooms are also very nice, they remind me of a VERY VERY well groomed apartment.
		<br> 
		<br>
				<br>
		I highly recommend to try this out, even if it is far from main Tagaytay.
